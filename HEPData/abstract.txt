The production cross sections of $\mathrm{D}^0$, $\mathrm{D}^+$, and $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ hadrons originating from beauty-hadron decays
(i.e. non-prompt) were measured for the first time at midrapidity in proton--lead (p--Pb) collisions at the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{{s_\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02 \mathrm{{TeV}}$.
Nuclear modification factors ($R_{\mathrm{pPb}}$) of non-prompt $\mathrm{D}^0$, $\mathrm{D}^+$, and $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ are calculated as a function of the transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{{T}}$)
to investigate the modification of the momentum spectra measured in p--Pb collisions with respect to those measured in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the same energy.
The $R_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ measurements are compatible with unity and with the measurements in the prompt charm sector, and do not show a significant $p_\mathrm{{T}}$ dependence.
The $p_\mathrm{{T}}$-integrated cross sections and $p_\mathrm{{T}}$-integrated $R_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ of non-prompt $\mathrm{D}^0$ and $\mathrm{D}^+$ mesons are also computed by extrapolating the visible cross sections down to $p_\mathrm{{T}}$ = 0.
The non-prompt D-meson $R_{\mathrm{pPb}}$integrated over $p_\mathrm{{T}}$ is compatible with unity and with model calculations implementing modification of the parton distribution functions of nucleons bound in nuclei with respect to free nucleons.
The non-prompt $\Lambda_{c}^{+}/\mathrm{D}^0$ and $\mathrm{D}^+/\mathrm{D}^0$ production ratios are computed to investigate hadronisation mechanisms of beauty quarks into mesons and baryons.
The measured ratios as a function of $p_\mathrm{{T}}$ display a similar trend to that measured for charm hadrons in the same collision system, indicating a modification of the hadronisation from pp to p--Pb collisions for beauty quarks similar to that observed for charm quarks.
