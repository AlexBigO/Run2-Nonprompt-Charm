# Run2-Nonprompt-Charm
Repo to merge D0, D+ and Lambdac results for the article.

## Results

Folder containing all our analysis results (cross sections and RpPb).

## Utils

Folder containing macros for:
- rebinning results: histograms and uncertainty propagation
- computing ratios: for D+/D0 or Lambdac/D
- computing averages: for D0 and D+

## Plots

Folder containing *templated* macros (so we all have the same figures) for:
- raw yield extraction
- non-prompt fraction (cut variation method output)
- cross section
- nuclear modification factor (differential and integrated)
